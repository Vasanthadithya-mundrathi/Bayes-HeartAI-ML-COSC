# Bayes to the Future: Heart Disease Prediction Report

## Dataset Overview
- **Total Records**: 302
- **Features**: 23
- **Heart Disease Rate**: 54.30%

## Data Preprocessing
✅ **Duplicate Removal**: Cleaned dataset by removing duplicate records
✅ **Missing Value Handling**: Processed missing values appropriately  
✅ **Min-Max Normalization**: Applied to continuous features (age, trestbps, chol, thalach, oldpeak)
✅ **Feature Discretization**: Converted continuous variables to categorical bins

## Bayesian Network Structure
Based on the challenge requirements, implemented structure:
- **age → fbs → target** (primary pathway as specified)
- **age → chol → target** (cholesterol pathway)  
- **age → thalach → target** (heart rate pathway)

## Network Components
- **Nodes**: 5 (age_group, fbs, chol_category, hr_category, target)
- **Edges**: 6 directed edges representing causal relationships
- **Estimation Method**: Maximum Likelihood Estimation from data

## Key Features Implemented
1. **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicates, handled missing values
2. **Min-Max Normalization**: Applied to all continuous numeric columns
3. **Bayesian Network**: Built with predefined structure as specified
4. **Maximum Likelihood Estimation**: Trained using conditional probabilities from data
5. **Probabilistic Inference**: Generates predictions with confidence scores
6. **Health Insights**: Provides meaningful medical interpretations

## Model Predictions
The model makes probabilistic predictions for heart disease risk based on:
- Age group (young, middle-aged, senior, elderly)
- Fasting blood sugar levels (normal/high)
- Cholesterol categories (normal, borderline, high)
- Heart rate categories (low, normal, high)

## Files Generated
